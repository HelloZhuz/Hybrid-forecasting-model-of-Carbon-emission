Carbon Emission Prediction System
Overview
Carbon dioxide, as the primary component of greenhouse gases, is a major driver of global warming, threatening human health and the ecological environment. To address the complexity of carbon emission data and improve prediction accuracy, we propose a novel hybrid model for carbon emission forecasting.

Methodology
Our model integrates advanced techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness:

1.C-CSSD (Correlation Integral and Correlation Dimension-based Singular Spectrum Decomposition)
Identifies and decomposes complex patterns in carbon emission data.
2.NNetEn (Neural Network Estimation Time Entropy)
Enhances feature extraction and non-linear modeling capabilities.
3.VMD (Variational Mode Decomposition)
Decomposes time series into intrinsic modes for better pattern recognition.
4.CPA-KELM (Carnivorous Plant Algorithm improved Kernel Extreme Learning Machine)
Optimizes parameters for improved learning and generalization.
5.CSA-LSSVM (Chameleon Swarm Algorithm improved Least Squares Support Vector Machine)
Further enhances model performance with swarm intelligence.
6.IOWA (Induced Ordered Weighted Averaging) Operator
Combines predictions from multiple models for robust results.
7.EC (Error Correction)
Adjusts final predictions to minimize errors.
The integrated model is named C-CSSD-NNetEn-VMD-CPA-KELM-IOWA-CSA-LSSVM-EC .

Features
High Accuracy : Combines multiple advanced algorithms for superior prediction performance.
