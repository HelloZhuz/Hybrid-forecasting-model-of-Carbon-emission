# Hybrid-forecasting-model-of-Carbon-emission
As the main component of greenhouse gas, the increasing emission of carbon dioxide leads to global warming, which has a direct and lasting negative impact on people's life and development. It is crutial to establish an accurate carbon emission prediction model for human health and ecological environment protection. Aiming at that high complexity of carbon emission data, a combined prediction model of carbon emission, including singular spectrum decomposition (SSD) based on correlation integral and correlation dimension (C-CSSD), neural network estimation time entropy (NNetEn), variational mode decomposition (VMD), kernel extreme learning machine improved by carnivorous plant algorithm (CPA-KELM), least squares support vector machine improved by chameleon swarm algorithm (CSA-LSSVM), induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator and error correction (EC), named C-CSSD-NNetEn-VMD-CPA-KELM-IOWA-CSA-LSSVM-EC, is proposed.
